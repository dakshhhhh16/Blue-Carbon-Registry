## 🚀 How to Run Locally

### Prerequisites
* Node.js (v18 or higher)
* npm or yarn
* A `.env` file in the root directory and in the `backend` directory.

### Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/aryanraj45/blue-carbon-registry.git](https://github.com/aryanraj45/blue-carbon-registry.git)
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd blue-carbon-registry
    ```

3.  **Install frontend dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    
4.  **Navigate to the backend directory and install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    cd backend
    npm install
    cd .. 
    ```

5.  **Create Environment Files:**
    * In the project's **root directory**, create a file named `.env` for the frontend:
        ```env
        VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY=YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY
        ```
    * Inside the **`backend` directory**, create another file named `.env` for the server:
        ```env
        MONGO_URI=YOUR_MONGODB_CONNECTION_STRING
        JWT_SECRET=YOUR_SUPER_SECRET_JWT_KEY
        ```

6.  **Run the backend server:**
    ```bash
    npm run server
    ```
    *(This command should be configured in your root `package.json` to run the backend server)*

7.  **Run the frontend development server:**
    * Open a **new terminal** in the same root directory.
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

8.  **Open the application:**
    * Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173` (or the port specified in your terminal).
